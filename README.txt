##General:
 -This project is the product of Kora Hughes for the purpose of her AI Project #1 at NYU (Due: Nov. 11th, 2021)
 -Input files, requirements.pdf, and Samples (/testing) provided by professor Wong

##How To Run:
 -To run this project, place all valid game files within the /Input directory folder
 -Then, from the Puzzel-AI project directory, run the jup-puzzle file with python3
 -This can be accomplished by typing the following line into the terminal...
####python3 jup-puzzle.py
 -The resulting files will be in the /Output directory
 --Note: python3 is needed due to terminal output's use of "\r" and will crash when run with just python
 --Note: running code with existing output files in the output folder will result in undefined behavior (overwritting)

##Other Info:
 -Repo History: https://github.com/AlphaError/Puzzel-AI
 -If you want access to the repo email me at khughes@nyu.edu
 -For more vercatility; you may also edit the weights array to output solutions for different A* heuristic weights

enjoy! I had fun with this project :)

-is README.txt okay instead of a pdf?
-requirements for README?:: explaining how to run & compile your program && copy and paste output files and src code
